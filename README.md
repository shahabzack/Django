Django Login and Registration with CRUD Operations
Project Overview
This project is a Django-based web application implementing user authentication with login and registration functionality. Additionally, I’ve added CRUD operations to the Django admin panel, allowing for the management of users by the admin. The goal was to practice user authentication and how to manage users from the admin interface.

Features
User Registration: Users can register an account by providing necessary details.
User Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials.
Admin CRUD Operations:
The Django admin interface allows the creation, editing, and deletion of users.
Admin can manage user data and permissions (e.g., active status, admin rights).
What I Learned
User Authentication: Implementing user login and registration helped me understand session management, how to create user models, and how to authenticate users in Django.
Admin Panel Customization: Adding CRUD operations in the Django admin panel deepened my understanding of the admin interface, user management, and Django's built-in admin functionalities.
Django Fundamentals: Working with Django’s built-in features like forms, models, and views strengthened my knowledge of web development with Django.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language
Django: Web framework
SQLite: Default database (can be replaced with other databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL)
HTML/CSS: Frontend for the login and registration pages
Bootstrap: For responsive design
